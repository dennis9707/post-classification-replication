There are two problems:   The onTouchListener bind to mLinearLayout in CustomRelativeLayout is only triggered once and only for ACTION_DOWN. I see the log output only once The note never changes the position, it is never redrawn with the changed matrix... I see the output stated in  never after the touch happened. <ol>  First might be because the SurfaceView also handles touch events. But I thought if the CustomRelativeLayout handles it first, it should work.  Some ideas?  Edit for solution  Thanks to Xil3 I was able to remove the wall I was run into... here is my solution:  my note xml:    And here is my constructor:    I also found a bugfeatureissue, which is absolutely new for me: When I remove the background in my note root element which is currently transparent the note is only visible within the 200dp widthheight I have set in the inner LinearLayout. So its not , its  even as I set it to . So  and  only use the given  when a background is set... weired... ",it should work.,28,1358

4922185,DISCREPANCY,Confusing PNG banding solutions,"I've run into issues with banding of my PNG files. Digging into the problem has yielded two solutions. Both make sense individually, but together they don't. The solutions I've discovered:  1 Move the PNG file into the ""raw"" folder. This prevents AAPT from ""optimizing"" the image which results in banding.  2 Change the pixel format of your Activity's window to RGBA_8888 i.e. in onCreate add this line ""getWindow.setFormatPixelFormat.RGBA_8888"". On Android 2.2 and lower the default pixel format is 16-bit 565.   I have tried both of these and they correct the banding effect in my images, however now I am even more confused as to what Android is doing.   On the one hand, if I leave my PNG in the drawable folder it is ""optimized"" which results in a banding effect in the image. It magically goes away when I change the pixel format to 32-bit. If the image was ""optimized"" though, I would have expected the banding to remain.  On the other hand, if I move the PNG to the raw folder it will retain the nice gradient and display nicely even though the pixelFormat is supposedly 16-bit.  If anyone has any insight into what is going on I would appreciate it.  Thanks,  -Dan ",I have tried,31,1174

There are three main reasons why I would like to manage the sample bytes directly:   OpenSL uses an AudioTrack layer to playstopetc for Player Objects.  This does not only introduce unwanted overhead, but it also has several bugs, and rapid startsstops of the player cause lots of problems. I need to manipulate the byte buffer directly for custom DSP effects. The clips I'm going to be playing are small, and can all be loaded into memory to avoid file IO overhead.  Plus, enqueueing my own buffers will allow me to reduce latency by writing 0's to the output sink, and simply switching to sample bytes when they are playing, rather than STOPPING, PAUSING and PLAYING the AudioTrack. <ol>  Okay, so justifications complete - here's what I've tried - I have a Sample struct which contains, essentially, an input and output track, and a byte array to hold the samples.  The input is my FileDescriptor player, and the output is a SimpleBufferQueue object.  Here's my struct:    after initializing a file player fdPlayerObject, and malloc-ing memory for my byte buffer with    I'm getting its BufferQueue interface with    Then I instantiate an output player:    When I want to play the sample, I am using:    However, this causes my app to freeze and shut down.

Since the pictures can be quite big, I decided to save it into sd card. I'm using the code below to determine whether the sd card is available or not. If it is I'm using SD card if not I'm using phone memory. But the Issue is, If I eject the SD card, my application crashes on start up and I get File Not Found exception. As far as I understand, since the phone has internal SD card,   android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageState.equalsandroid.os.Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED   is always returning ""mounted"". How can I understand the external SD card is really ejected ?  EDIT: I tried to check whether the SD card is available or not , since I'm using the code below and since I have internal SD card in my phone  android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageState.equalsandroid.os.Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED   always returns true and It creates the directory without having and SD card.

I need around 10MB of cache space to save some of my files, and with this solution I'm not sure if it's that effective I will have my content both in SD card and phone memory if the user runs the application when there is no SD card.

I am using OpenCV for Android.  My question is as follows: What methods would be most appropriate for performing Coin Recognition on Android using OpenCV?  The method I have tried so far is below maybe I'm doing it wrong, or I'm just going down the wrong route completely  I am currently using OpenCV for Android no native code! and am using various Feature Detection algorithms to identify key points in an image i.e. ORB, FAST, STAR. I believed that it would simply be a matter of calculating the Euclidean distance between each of these keypoints within an extracted image and a set of known test data to identify the most similar images and therefore recognise the coin, but it turns out that this method alone is not appropriate as effects such as lighting, coin rotation etc. have too much of an effect on the Feature extraction plus coins have surprisingly similar features...  Generically speaking I am looking for advice on whether any form of pre-image processing would be useful? What alternative methods are available? Or any tips on how to improve my current methods.  NOTE: I have seen plenty of documents out there about Coin Detection, but I am looking at Coin Recognition specifically.  Thanks in advance!

11726100,CONCEPTUAL,Why would Application sometimes restart on killProcess?,"Ordinarily, exiting my application by calling:  android.os.Process.killProcessandroid.os.Process.myPid;   performs well without incident.  But every once in a while, the application will restart again after exiting!.  The relevant log snippet shows:    I know that, by the design of the Android OS, killProcess isn't the proper way to terminate an application. This is because killProcess stops the process immediately without giving any way or chance for the app to prevent it or prepare for it.   I know that when I call finish, the application stack is just pushed to the background and still exists in the memory. Android itself decides when to close the application i.e. remove its instance from the memory and generally this is done when the application becomes ""the oldest not used for the longest time"". Its behavior is actually more predictable if it's really the last one.  The problem is that finish only stops and destroys the activity for which it was called. It doesn't stop other activities spawned by the application or other activities. So, for ease of test &amp; debug during development, I am using  killProcess as a convenient shortcut.  But now I see that this has the side effect of the application sometimes restarting immediately after killing itself -- all within 30 milliseconds.  A straightforward solution would be to iterate through all application's activities and finish them. But before proceeding with this, I am dying to understand what in the Android OS makes an application resurrect itself.  Why would Android make a killed Application restart?

12241996,ERRORS,"Importing Apache Pig to an Android project causes ""Unable to execute dex: Java heap space"" error","I was trying to serialize a TreeMap in my Android app so I can save it to a SharedPreferences, as suggested in this StackOverflow Q&amp;A. It's for an ArrayList, but I took my chances anyway. The point is to use the ObjectSerializer class in the Apache Pig project to serialize the TreeMap into a String and save it in that data type in the shared prefs.  As soon as I imported the .jar without Hadoop, however, I began getting a lot of errors. When I run my app in the emulator I use Eclipse, the status bar at the bottom of my IDE never goes past the message ""Launching [app name] 100%..."" Then, after a long while, this appears:    If I wait a little longer, more dialog boxes pop up on top of each other:    My questions are:   What's going on and why is this happening? Might this be a bug with Apache Pig? Is there an alternative library which I can use to serialize my TreeMap? Right now, my workaround is to serialize it myself, as described in this tutorial, and save it in a file in the devices' internal memory separate from the shared prefs. <ol> ","""Unable to execute dex: Java heap space"""" error",96,1059

I am using OpenCV for Android.  My question is as follows: What methods would be most appropriate for performing Coin Recognition on Android using OpenCV?  The method I have tried so far is below maybe I'm doing it wrong, or I'm just going down the wrong route completely  I am currently using OpenCV for Android no native code! and am using various Feature Detection algorithms to identify key points in an image i.e. ORB, FAST, STAR. I believed that it would simply be a matter of calculating the Euclidean distance between each of these keypoints within an extracted image and a set of known test data to identify the most similar images and therefore recognise the coin, but it turns out that this method alone is not appropriate as effects such as lighting, coin rotation etc. have too much of an effect on the Feature extraction plus coins have surprisingly similar features...  Generically speaking I am looking for advice on whether any form of pre-image processing would be useful? What alternative methods are available? Or any tips on how to improve my current methods.  NOTE: I have seen plenty of documents out there about Coin Detection, but I am looking at Coin Recognition specifically.  Thanks in advance! ",how to improve,27,1413

17801119,API_USAGE,How do I prevent .git directory from getting copied to bin directory during rebuild?,"A .git directory keeps reappearing in my project, inside a directory that I think should be ignored. It reappears each time I clean the project or refresh it in Eclipse. The duplicated .git directory results in redundant files that prevent the project from building.  I have an Android project in Eclipse that links source from a Java project, which is the way LibGDX handles a project. The .git directory that I don't want contains a file that causes a conflict, so I have to delete it every time I want to build to device.  It is creating the directory MyProjectbinclasses.git.  But I have bin in my .gitignore file. My repository is in MyProject.  The conflicting file is \bin\classes.git\COMMIT_EDITMSG. This conflicts with a file in my linked source Java project: \gen.git\COMMIT_EDITMSG. Also the same issue, because I have \gen in the .gitignore of that project.  I am pretty sure either Eclipse or ADT that is copying the .git directory over to the bin directory when it rebuilds or cleans the project.  So my question now is, how do I get Eclipse andor ADT to stop doing that?  If you want to see my old .gitignore, which I think is irrelevant because it was set up correctly to ignore the bin directory, you can click the ""Edited"" link to see it in this post's history.

17814668,API_USAGE,Android Real-Time Plotting,"I am building an android real-time accelerometer plotting application using achartengine. I have done a lot of research to solve the problems I mention below but couldn't find any  working solutions.  The case is this: I am collecting accelerometer values and filling three XYSeries objects one per axis. I use the XYSeries objects to plot the graph with the three timeseries. I want the graph to livescroll as the time passes. So I am using a different thread in the activity to update the graph, I am updating the X-axis and then I am calling   view_eeg1.repaint;   where view_eeg1 is of type GraphicalView  However, when I call the repaint method more than 3 or 4 times per second GC_CONCURRENT kicks in. In this thread Dan is discussing a similar issue, but I couldn't make it work smoothly.   Moreover, even if I ignore the GC_CONCURRENT warning messages and try to play with the app, when I move the device a lot, that is the graph becomes really crowded, the application crashes.   So, the main question here is, how to use achartengine for real-time plotting when the sampling and refresh rate become high?  I hope I am describing the problem in adequate detail, please let me know if you need more info. ",how to use,26,1213

19897628,API_USAGE,Need to handle uncaught exception and send log file,"UPDATE: Please see ""accepted"" solution below  When my app creates an unhandled exception, rather than simply terminating, I'd like to first give the user an opportunity to send a log file.  I realize that doing more work after getting a random exception is risky but, hey, the worst is the app finishes crashing and the log file doesn't get sent.  This is turning out to be trickier than I expected :    What works: 1 trapping the uncaught exception, 2 extracting log info and writing to a file.  What doesn't work yet: 3 starting an activity to send email.  Ultimately, I'll have yet another activity to ask the user's permission.  If I get the email activity working, I don't expect much trouble for the other.  The crux of the problem is that the unhandled exception is caught in my Application class.  Since that isn't an Activity, it's not obvious how to start an activity with Intent.ACTION_SEND.  That is, normally to start an activity one calls startActivity and resumes with onActivityResult.  These methods are supported by Activity but not by Application.  Any suggestions on how to do this?  Here are some code snips as a starting guide:   ",how to do this,51,1152

I have an Android project in Eclipse that links source from a Java project, which is the way LibGDX handles a project. The .git directory that I don't want contains a file that causes a conflict, so I have to delete it every time I want to build to device.  It is creating the directory MyProjectbinclasses.git.

This conflicts with a file in my linked source Java project: \gen.git\COMMIT_EDITMSG. Also the same issue, because I have \gen in the .gitignore of that project.

Here is the code:    This is the JSONParser Class    And this is the PHP Web Service    I do know for a fact that the PHP is right, since it is giving me the data I want, but the application doesn't work in my tablet, nor does it work in the emulator. Also, note that on the MainActivity class, I use the StrictMode.setThreadPolicy. This is because I read that when I get the onNetworkMainThreadException, this usually fixes the problem even though it is unsafe. I was planning to change it, of course, after I find out why I can't connect. The error is this one:    I would not be asking if I hadn't already tried everything I found in here and everything I found on the internet. I need to make this work soon, so please any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated. ",I have tried doing everything ,40,1150

10770979,DISCREPANCY,Is it possible to get a byte buffer directly from an audio asset in OpenSL ES for Android?,"I would like to get a byte buffer from an audio asset using the OpenSL ES FileDescriptor object, so I can enqueue it repeatedly to a SimpleBufferQueue, instead of using SL interfaces to playstopseek the file.  There are three main reasons why I would like to manage the sample bytes directly:   OpenSL uses an AudioTrack layer to playstopetc for Player Objects.  This does not only introduce unwanted overhead, but it also has several bugs, and rapid startsstops of the player cause lots of problems. I need to manipulate the byte buffer directly for custom DSP effects. The clips I'm going to be playing are small, and can all be loaded into memory to avoid file IO overhead.  Plus, enqueueing my own buffers will allow me to reduce latency by writing 0's to the output sink, and simply switching to sample bytes when they are playing, rather than STOPPING, PAUSING and PLAYING the AudioTrack. <ol>  Okay, so justifications complete - here's what I've tried - I have a Sample struct which contains, essentially, an input and output track, and a byte array to hold the samples.  The input is my FileDescriptor player, and the output is a SimpleBufferQueue object.  Here's my struct:    after initializing a file player fdPlayerObject, and malloc-ing memory for my byte buffer with    I'm getting its BufferQueue interface with    Then I instantiate an output player:    When I want to play the sample, I am using:    However, this causes my app to freeze and shut down.  Something is wrong here. Also, I would prefer to not get the samples from the File Descriptor's BufferQueue each time.  Instead, I'd like to permanently store it in a byte array, and Enqueue that to the output whenever I like.   ",Something is wrong,90,1700

39007805,API_CHANGE,Android Studio cannot find classes after upgrading version of dependency,"I have two projects: library and app. I have previously uploaded library to jCentre, and library is listed as an external dependency of app in its build.gradle file. Recently I published a newer version of library and updated the dependency version code in app's build.gradle file, but when I did this Android Studio could no longer find any of the classes from library.  To test the library, I created an entirely new project and added library as a dependency. In this scenario Android Studio finds the classes just fine. I've compared every line of the build.gradle files: They have the same min and target SDK version, they have the same proguard config, they're literally identical. They projects are also using the exact same version of the android plugin and the exact same gradle version.  I also tried entirely deleting app from my machine and re-checked it out from git. This did not solve the problem. I've tried all the usual steps of cleaning the project and rebuilding the project, deleting all build files, invalidating caches, etc.  So can anyone tell me why Android Studio cannot find any of the library classes after upgrading the dependency version?

39007805,API_CHANGE,Android Studio cannot find classes after upgrading version of dependency,"I have two projects: library and app. I have previously uploaded library to jCentre, and library is listed as an external dependency of app in its build.gradle file. Recently I published a newer version of library and updated the dependency version code in app's build.gradle file, but when I did this Android Studio could no longer find any of the classes from library.  To test the library, I created an entirely new project and added library as a dependency. In this scenario Android Studio finds the classes just fine. I've compared every line of the build.gradle files: They have the same min and target SDK version, they have the same proguard config, they're literally identical. They projects are also using the exact same version of the android plugin and the exact same gradle version.  I also tried entirely deleting app from my machine and re-checked it out from git. This did not solve the problem. I've tried all the usual steps of cleaning the project and rebuilding the project, deleting all build files, invalidating caches, etc.  So can anyone tell me why Android Studio cannot find any of the library classes after upgrading the dependency version?
