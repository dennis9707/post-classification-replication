Pressing Send causes the clock app to quickly flash on screen before the second activity of my app comes into the foreground.

What I'm trying to accomplish is make a generic class which extends from AsyncTask and can be used to process in background different tasks. I've been reading and found a work around like this:     I just don't want to do this every single time I need to use an AsyncTask just to use .executeOnExecutorAsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR I SHOULD USE executeOnExecutor for better performance on anything that supports it instead of execute;     The problem is that no all the tasks are the same so parameters change as well as the result of those tasks. Has someone faced the same problem? Any recomendation?  Thanks in advance. "

27970497,CONCEPTUAL,Stopping onCreate being executed on screen rotation in Android,"I have an activity with 4 elements. A spinner containing a list of dates, a spinner containing a list of hours, a button and a list view. The spinner's selected items are used to form a web service URL which is called when the button is clicked and the response is shown in the list view.  The issue is if the user views the app in portrait mode, chooses a date, chooses an hour and clicks the button, the response of the web service call is shown in the list view however, if the device is rotated to landscape then the data in the list view is gone because in order to get it there a button click is needed.  I understand that onCreate is called when the screen is rotated. I do not want to force the orientation so is there any way I can stop the list view being cleared? Note that the selected values in my spinners remain the same after rotation, it is just the response in the list view that is lost. "
