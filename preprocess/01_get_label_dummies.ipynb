The code beneath doesn't crash and reports that it's firing up the camera... it just never renders on the screen.  I have no idea what I'm doing incorrectly.  My guess is that it has something to do with the display thread never having the urge to redraw anything after it renders the initial screen, but I even tried adding a button and initiating the camera to render on the surface view upon button click, but that has not provoked it any further. most of this code is pulled directly out of the Android sample code, so, I'm sure it's correct.

So, step by step;  -I tried runtime.exec\"chmod 777 etchosts\" method and this didn\\'t work without any exception or error message.   -Then I tried to use File.setWritable method but it doesn\\'t exist in my andoid system, though it seems supposed to be android 2.2 according to javadoc.   -Lastly, I tried to set working directory with System.setProperty\"user.dir\",\"etc\" and use openFileOutput\"hosts\", MODE_WORLD_WRITABLE but of course this didn\\'t work, either.

This prevents AAPT from \"optimizing\" the image which results in banding.  2 Change the pixel format of your Activity\\'s window to RGBA_8888 i.e. in onCreate add this line \"getWindow.setFormatPixelFormat.RGBA_8888\". On Android 2.2 and lower the default pixel format is 16-bit 565.   I have tried both of these and they correct the banding effect in my images, however now I am even more confused as to what Android is doing.   On the one hand, if I leave my PNG in the drawable folder it is \"optimized\" which results in a banding effect in the image. It magically goes away when I change the pixel format to 32-bit. If the image was \"optimized\" though, I would have expected the banding to remain.  On the other hand, if I move the PNG to the raw folder it will retain the nice gradient and display nicely even though the pixelFormat is supposedly 16-bit.

Given an Statistic I need also know what are the related Achievements in order to check them when the Statistic changes.   Both Stats and Achievements have an unique id.  My problem is I donï¿½t know whats the best datas structures for representing that. By the way I'm using:    For the first point where the index of the array is the Achievement ID and the HashMap contains the StatisticTargetValue pairs. And a:    For the second point where the index is the StatisticID and the item is the collection of Achievements related.  Then I need to handle both objects keeping it coherence.   Is there an easier way of representing that? Thanks \", ['REVIEW']]\n",

This is because killProcess stops the process immediately without giving any way or chance for the app to prevent it or prepare for it.   I know that when I call finish, the application stack is just pushed to the background and still exists in the memory. Android itself decides when to close the application i.e. remove its instance from the memory and generally this is done when the application becomes \"the oldest not used for the longest time\". Its behavior is actually more predictable if it\\'s really the last one.  The problem is that finish only stops and destroys the activity for which it was called. It doesn\\'t stop other activities spawned by the application or other activities. So, for ease of test &amp; debug during development, I am using  killProcess as a convenient shortcut.

Could anybody have the genuine answer for this.  I also read the following post on Android FAQs     What kinds of devices can be Android   compatible?       The Android software can   be ported to a lot of different kinds   of devices, including some on which   third-party apps won't run properly.   The Android Compatibility Definition   Document CDD spells out the specific   device configurations that will be   considered compatible.      For example, though the Android source   code could be ported to run on a phone   that doesn't have a camera, the CDD   requires that in order to be   compatible, all phones must have a   camera. This allows developers to rely   on a consistent set of capabilities   when writing their apps.      The CDD will evolve over time to   reflect market realities. For   instance, the 1.6 CDD only allows cell   phones, but the 2.1 CDD allows devices   to omit telephony hardware, allowing   for non-phone devices such as   tablet-style music players to be   compatible. As we make these changes,   we will also augment Android Market to   allow developers to retain control   over where their apps are available.   To continue the telephony example, an   app that manages SMS text messages   would not be useful on a media player,   so Android Market allows the developer   to restrict that app exclusively to   phone devices.

The data changes very often i.e. 1-2 times per second.  Sometimes the number of rows in the dataset changes too but certainly not as often as the data in the cells changes.   There are two ways to update the data in the cells, as far as I can tell:   Have the background thread notify the UI thread that new data is ready, and the UI thread can then call BaseAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged.  However, I have read in more than one place that if that method is called often, it will be slow, because the ListView has to restructure all of its subviews Views. If the dataset count has not changed, I could possibly find all of the visible ListView cells that are associated with the changed data, and update the values manually without calling notifyDataSetChanged.  This would probably work, but I think its unfortunate that I have to update the views manually when the List Adapter is supposed to handle the update notifications and mechanisms for me when I notify it.  This method also won't work if the dataset count changes over time i.e. not only is the data within each cell of the ListView changing, but the total number of cells in the ListView can grow or shrink based on the background thread supplying realtime data.

Also, if for some reason something happens on googles endlike their servers are down - not likely but could happen I have no way to contact them, and am at their time frame.  Now if I do my own thing a basic approach where I send the message that the user creates, and then periodically check the server to see if any new messages have arrived seems ok except, in order to have a decent user experience, my polling of my server would have to be like ever 5 seconds or so, and that is going to chew up battery like crazy.

Here's a small description of my question:  My custom CursorAdapter overrides newView and bindView instead of getView as most examples I see. I use the ViewHolder pattern between these 2 methods. But my main issue was with the custom layout I'm using for each list item, it contains a ToggleButton.  The problem was that the button state was not kept when a list item view scrolled out of view and then scrollbed back into view. This problem existed because the cursor was never aware that the database data changed when the ToggleButton was pressed and it was always pulling the same data. I tried to requery the cursor when clicking the ToggleButton and that solved the problem, but it was very slow.  I have solved this issue and I'm posting the whole class here for review. I've commented the code thoroughly for this specific question to better explain my coding decisions.  Does this code look good to you? Would you improveoptimize or change it somehow?

For each sendLocation call I make a new thread. While connectivity is ok, everything works fine. But, when sending fails and the user is driving, the location read happens very often and there are big chances that there are 2-3 threads all trying to send the same unsent locations. If Thread1 receives the list and tries to send it, Thread2 and Thread3 should not be able to read it and try to send it as Thread1 may send it successfully. How can I prevent this from happening ? How can I make sure Thread2 does not read the list ?  From what I am thinking now, I could add a new field in the table \"processing\" and for all the rows retrieved for sending, update the field to true. In this case Thread2 will only get the processing=false rows. Is this a solution ? Any other recommendations ? I still believe that there is a slight change for Thread2 to get the data, while Thread1 is updating processing... Thanks.  Later edit: Extra thoughts and ideas I have tried this approach    From what I read, this threadPool should force threads to execute one after another, right ? even I do have a feeling I misunderstood its purpose  If so, what happens if I get no connectivity for an hour ? For each location read, a new thread is added... but how long does this thread last ? I am concern what happens if the user is driving really fast, I could get locations read every 1-2 seconds, would this mechanism hold my web access in a queue, one thread after another ?  In another order of thoughts, what if onCreate method of the service I make a new thread. Something like:    and in startLocationListener I start GPS location read. Will onLocationChanged be executed on this thread and won\\'t interfere with my UI thread ?  Would it be wiser to use a Service that runs in its own thread ? So I won\\'t have to worry about threading ?  Using the current approach, the app does the job but there is something wrong happening, randomly and can\\'t figure out the reason: one of my activities binds to the service to receive updates, I carefully unbind it when the app gets onPause... but sometimes the service keeps running, as I can see its notification icon displayed.

      "[15651747, 'Static Utility class with ContextActivity - Android', \"Over the development of an Android app I've come to a collection of utility-type methods that I have put into a static class. All these methods are used across multiple Activities and most of them do not require any information from the calling Activity.  However, I now have some methods that require the Context of the Activity and one that requires the Activity itself. Let me exemplify some of them:   getDeviceNaturalOrientation - Uses an Activity's getWindow.getWindowManager.getDefaultDisplay to access the displays rotation, width, and height to determine the device's natural orientation. getDeviceOrientation - Similar to the above but to get the current orientation createFile - Uses the Context to to access some resources strings and to create and show some Toasts   Now, my big questions regarding this Utils class are:   So far, each function takes a Context parameter which I pass from whatever Activity I'm on, but would it be OK to create a static Context or Activity variable in the Utils class and set it at the beginning of each Activity like in onCreate? This variable would be used in whatever functions require a Context or Activity instance. Assuming the above is not recommended, is it OK to pass an Activity parameter to a method or is there a reason to only pass an Activity as Context? The methods I use for the device orientation functions above are specific to Activity objects, not Context, so either I pass as Activity or pass as Context and cast into Activity the latter sounding like a terrible idea.   Also, I am very open to the idea that this Util class may not be the way to go for these methods that require ContextActivity, so I would welcome alternatives that would still prevent having copies of these methods in each activity class that uses them. \", ['REVIEW']]\n",

      "[18341622, 'Android Studio wgradle: Package r does not exist', 'Final Edit:  This was kind of a long question with several edits, and I wasn\\'t necessarily doing the right thing at each step of the way.  For anyone who stumbles on this question and is having trouble converting a project to gradle in Android Studio, I\\'d suggest checking out this repository mentioned in question # 16718026 and trying to import that and compile and run it.  Once you have something working it\\'s easier to see what might be wrong with your own project.  To summarize, here\\'s what I did to convert a non-Gradle Android Studio project into a working Gradle one, using Android Studio .2.5, which auto installed Gradle 1.6 and the Gradle Plugin .5 for me.  1 Created a new blank Android Studio project with an icon and an activity.  NOTE: I didn\\'t realize this at first because I was learning Android and Gradle at the same time, but Android Studio in this version anyway actually sets you up with a multi-project setup, which was confusing for me.  Multi-Project means there\\'s another folder above your project in the hierarchy, giving a location to store settings for all projects.  AS did not create a build.gradle file in the subproject folder in my case, FrontlineSMS, despite a video guide indicating it would.  So I had to create that subproject build.gradle file and also create a very simple settings.gradle see Update 2 below.  2 Copied src, res, .git, lib, .gitignore, and AndroidManifest.xml to the root of the new project.  3 Used  to move these items to the appropriate places according to conventions in the Gradle Plugin User Guide, replacing or removing some existing files or folders in the blank project where necessary.  4 Created a  in my subproject folder and gave it some basic settings see below or in the question linked above  5 Imported the project as described in Update 4  Original question:  I\\'m a novice Android developer trying to convert an Android Studio project that does not currently use Gradle and compiles and runs just fine to one that uses Gradle on OS X.  I\\'m stuck on a Resource error, which I think may have to do with either my project structure, settings in the IDE, settings in the build.gradle files, or some combination of those.  The way I went about doing the conversion was to first create a new project in Android Studio, copy over files to appropriate locations, then add some settings in the IDE and build.gradle files.  My resulting project structure is,    Most notably, maybe, is I put the res folder at the same level as java and AndroidManifest.xml.  I\\'m trying to follow the conventions mentioned in the Gradle Plugin User Guide so I don\\'t have to customize too much in the build.gradle files.  I also marked the folder FrontlineSMSsrcmainjavanet as source because if I don\\'t then nothing attempts to compile.  I created a new build.gradle file in FrontlineSMSbuild.gradle because it did not exist when I made the new project, even though an instructional video on the Gradle website said it would.  In the IDE I also set the dependencies for the external libraries I have in lib.  When I try to compile via the IDE I get many  errors, indicating the auto generated R class is not getting generated or recognized.  This is defined in the project as,    in several files.  What can I do to make Android Studio  Gradle recognize the resources I have defined under srcmainres?  Reading up on others\\' questions, I notice that some solutions to this error involved marking a \"gen\" folder as a source root or \"cleaning\" the project.  I tried creating a gen folder in the root directory and marking it as source but that didn\\'t work. And, rebuilding the project just gives me the same errors.  My root build.gradle file has the following,    And the one under FrontlineSMSbuild.gradle has,    <strike>When I try to build from the command line using  I get this error,<strike>    In addition to my previous question, I\\'d appreciate any tips you can lend as to how this project should be structured.  This is not meant to be a multi-project setup.  Thanks for your help.  Update 1  I was able to generate an APK from the command line.  My main problem there is I was calling  from the wrong directory.  Calling it from FrontlineSMS worked.  I\\'m guessing Android Studio set me up with a multi-project setup when I just had one project, and I hadn\\'t entered all the settings for that, ie, I hadn\\'t created a settings.gradle file.  Update 2  Created the following settings.gradle file, which allows me to run  from the root directory where settings.gradle resides:    Note: the version of gradle I\\'m using here is the one installed by homebrew, 1.6.  If I use the gradlew wrapper that was installed it says ,    Searching the web for this error seems to indicate that Android doesn\\'t support 1.7 at this point, only 1.6 and maybe it\\'s always a version or two behind, yet this is the version that was installed by Android Studio when I created a new project!  Update 3 edit: this is basically all wrong, don\\'t follow this  Trying to build the project from Android Studio yields the same error as above regarding 1.6 being required.  I tried reimporting the project, though it said it could not find any source files.  I guess this means either 1 I have the wrong version of gradle and need to fix it and maybe 2 I\\'ll need to define source files in the build.gradle file after all, even though I thought I was following the conventions from the guide.  I tried copying  to replace  but that just gave a class or method not found error when I ran it via .  Attempted solution: In  there is a line  and I changed this to point to the 1.6 version,    Then the next time I ran  it downloaded a new version of of gradle into my home directory  which up until now I didn\\'t realize existed and now when I type  it says it is on 1.6, and everything builds via the command line using , resulting in apks.  So it seems to work from the command line, but I also want this to work from the IDE  In the IDE it now says    So I update the  file to say     And reopen the IDE, which tells me,    Are Android Studio gradle plugin and gradle versions tied together?  If so what do I want, gradle plugin .4 + gradle 1.6 or gradle plugin .5 and gradle 1.7?  And how do I properly install these?  Update 4  I finally got this to compile via both the command line and the IDE.  The trick was to import the project using Gradle after having created the basic Gradle files.  Thanks Ethan!  During the Import Project process there\\'s a step where you choose \"Create project from existing sources\" or \"Import project from external model\".  I\\'d been choosing the former when I should\\'ve chosen the latter and picked Gradle.  After that I selected \"use gradle-wrapper recommended\" and checked \"use auto-import\" and clicked Finish.

I took great care to make sure that everywhere in my code, I am set up right to just call notifyDataSetChanged on the adapter, I initialize the itemList once, and pass that to the adapter, and don\\'t re-initialize it ever.  It works like a charm, and the list view will update itself, but only for new items.  For existing items, the ListView will not update correctly.  For example if I have a listview that is displaying some custom items, and I need to update it I do this    now the listview will always update to show new items, but it will not update the views on the existing items.   Here is the real kicker that tells me it is an issue with the views: if I call  on a updated pre-existing item, the item returned will show the updated changes, meaning text1 and text2 will hold their new values even though it is not reflected in the listview!  If I call  then the list view will show the updates, but I have two problems with that, sometimes it flickers, and sometimes, just sometimes if I call it and it runs before the  can finish getting through to the listview, I get a \"List view not notified of data change\" error!  Does anyone know anything about this?    I wonder if what I should do is re-instantiate all my items before adding the to the list, using a copy constructor. Perhaps when notifying the adapter, the adapter will assume there is no changes if the  is still the same reference, and so will not redraw that view? or perhaps the adapter only draws new views for new items when notified?   To add another detail, if I scroll down making the updated view go off screen, and then come back to it, it displays the correct info as the listview refreshesremakes that view.  I guess I am needing the listview to refresh all its current views so,  may be what I have to do.  Does anyone know more about this?

Create the Dialog for example, using an AlertDialog.Builder, and then call the newly created Dialog\\'s show method. Call the Activity\\'s showDialog method, passing in an int that uniquely defines what sort of Dialog you want to build. Then override onCreateDialog to actually build the Dialog, and Android will display it for you.   The second method seems to be the standard practice but I\\'m curious if there is any reason it matters which one I use. Here\\'s all I can come up with:  Reasons to use Dialog.show   If you need to parameterize the Dialog in some way, it can be a little awkward to use Activity.showDialog, as described in this question. You may have to store a String or something in a member variable, just so that it can be retrieved moments later during onCreateDialog or onPrepareDialog. The logic for creating and modifying the dialog is spread out across a number of places, potentially making the code harder to read and maintain:    The place where you call showDialog Inside a potentially large switch statement in the overridden onCreateDialog method Inside a potentially large switch statement in the overridden onPrepareDialog method    Reasons to use Activity.showDialog:   The API docs for Activity.showDialog say that the Dialog is \"managed\" by the Activity which I suppose provides some benefit? But this is also true if you use the AlertDialog.Builder, I would think, because you pass in this as an argument to the Builder\\'s constructor.  If your Activity is going to show the same or a very similar Dialog several times, this option creates it only once, instead of creating a new one each time, thus putting less strain on the system as far as allocating space for new objects, garbage collection, etc.   So my question is, what are the criteria for deciding when to use Activity.showDialog and when to use Dialog.show, and why?
